Enthusiastic robotic engineer, highly motivated to research in the field of autonomous systems.
One of my primary goals is to solve complex tasks from unprocessed, high-dimensional, sensory input to tractable algebraic structures, in order to make these types of datasets accessible as training data for machine learning problems. __Multi-agent systems__ and __sensors fusion__ can efficiently improve the quality of data, furthermore, algorithms have to be chosen and implemented that enables parallel computation, data distribution, and resilience to failures. 

A key challenge in any of these systems is the model efficiency of a  perceived scene in a  way that simultaneously maximizes: data compression, and information retention.
My researchâ€™s purpose is to evaluate and investigate possible __distributed control algorithms__ to be used with multi-agent systems for estimation, collaboration or path-planning.

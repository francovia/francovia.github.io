Enthusiastic robotics engineer, highly driven with a passion for the research in the autonomous systems field. 
Machine learning with distributed frameworks form a very popular topic, and in this scenario, revisited techniques such as distributed Kalman filters and observers play a key role for state estimation. 
One of my primary goals in the field of research is to solve complex tasks from unprocessed, high-dimensional, sensory input to tractable algebraic structures. 
Multi-agent systems can efficiently solve this by use of collaboration to improve the quality of data.

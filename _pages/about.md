Enthusiastic researcher, highly motivated to work in the field of geometric deep learning.

Whether it is the navigation system in your car, the software used to create high school timetables, 
or decision support systems in manufacturing and logistics environments, you can be almost certain 
that modern combinatorial optimization techniques are being used. Technically speaking, 
combinatorial optimization is concerned with finding an optimal or near-optimal solution among a 
finite collection of possibilities. Many of the most important algorithmic problems in computer science 
are NP-hard, but their worst-case complexity does not diminish their practical role. This motivates 
vigorous research in the design of approximation algorithms and heuristic solvers.

Designing powerful and robust optimization algorithms requires significant time and specialized knowledge, 
especially for distributed and network systems. An alternative approach from the Machine Learning 
community is to develop generic learning algorithms that can be trained to solve combinatorial problems 
directly from instances of the problem itself. 
The focus is on efficient algorithms which, more formally, 
means algorithms with an execution time limited by a polynomial in the size of the input. 
Robust approximation algorithms to popular problems have immense practical applications and are 
the backbone of modern industries.

#### Why Graph Neural Networks?

Graphs are powerful tools to describe complex structures and systems. 
In particular, they provide a simple and elegant approach to most of the problems of software engineering, 
the main benefit of using graphs for describing software architectures is the ability to model dynamic 
reconfiguration of programs in an abstract and visual way. 
In other words, learning from graph data instead of vectorial data, 
generates new and different challenges, concerning expressiveness and computational complexity. 

Distributed computing is an important field of application for graph neural networks. 
Distributed computing wants to distribute the computational power into several decentralized components, 
ensuring a decreased workload of the central server. 
Distributed computing can be described as an optimization scheduling problem over graph structures. 
Combinatorial optimization problems over graphs are in general NP-hard and require many computational 
resources. However, graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art abilities in solving 
them with good heuristics and have automated the approximation process with graph structures.

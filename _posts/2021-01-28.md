Towards Resilient Architectures for Cognitive Systems
======

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate software algorithms and physical structures. 
To exceed the simple embedded systems of today, advances in CPS require several properties, 
particularly adaptability, resilience, and safety. Lean management of CPS with 
resilient architectures satisfies these requirements by combining data distribution with 
service-oriented structures. A practical use case: a moving robot in a warehouse.

**Introduction**

Several images of linear barcodes are given, and it is asked to:
- Find the ROI (Region Of Interest) with the Barcode and extract some characteristics
- Estimate quality parameters of Barcode according to the specific ISO/IEC 15416

In particolar, it is requested to compute the following quality parameters:
1. Symbol Contrast
2. Reflectance
3. Min edge contrast
4. Modulation
5. Defects
6. Overall Symbol Grade

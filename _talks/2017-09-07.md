In order to allow a decrease in the radioactivity of the exhausted target rooms, it will be necessary that they are placed in a suitably shielded temporary deposit for at least three years. 
To avoid access by an operator to the area of ​​interest, the movement was completely automated up to the storage phase. To this end, a prototype of the storage system has been designed and built, consisting of: a Cartesian manipulator, a telescopic arm and a six-seater storage rack. The control system has been implemented in a Schneider PLC which manages the deposit process. The operational procedure for storage begins with the preparation of the deposit by removing the shielding caps in the position where the new target chamber is to be inserted. The latter is then carried by the horizontal movement vehicle inside the storage area and positioned on a telescopic arm which, by translating, allows the Cartesian manipulator to grasp it. Finally, the positioning of the chamber inside the deposit and the closing of the shielding caps are foreseen. 
The control system was programmed through the Unity Pro development environment, supervision in SCADA Vijeo Citect.
